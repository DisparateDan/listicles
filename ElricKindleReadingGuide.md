## Elric: A Guide to Kindle Reading Order

Infuriatingly, the Elric stories on the Kindle are only available in a 'scrambled' arrangement across time and books, intermingled with other essays and fragments. While they form a curious academic study of the development of Moorcock's themes and style they are not the most satisfying when read that way. Unfortunately, reading them in a purely chronological,  narrative order tends to be jarring, since Moorcock inserted newer works into the timeline, retconning the style, feel and nature of Elric. Of course the writing is better in the newer books.

Instead, I recommend reading 'canonical' or 'pure/classic' Elric first - i.e. the primal, high-fantasy saga of a doomed anti-hero. Then, reading the later books layers in a newer appreciation of the metaphysics of Elric's universe, his relationship to the Eternal Champion cycles, and Moorcock's evolving philosophical voice. It happens that the later books are written with the expectation of some beforehand knowledge of Elric's eventual fate.

Enjoy.
